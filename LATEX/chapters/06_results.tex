    during the training of the vanilla NARX (dashed line) and the physics-constrained NARX (solid line). The three data rows each indicate
    \emph{one hidden layer} with $64, 16$ and $4$ hidden neurons respectively. The physics-constrained NARX converges visibly faster
    than the vanilla NARX.}
