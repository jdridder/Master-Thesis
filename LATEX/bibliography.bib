  abstract = {Abstract The ability to accurately model and simulate chemical processes has been paramount to the growing success and efficiency in process design and operation. These improvements usually come with increasing complexity of the underlying models leading to substantial computational effort in their use. It may also occur that the structure of the model is sometimes unknown making optimization and study difficult. To circumvent these issues, mathematically simpler models, commonly known as surrogate models, have been designed and used to successfully replace these complex, underlying models with much success. This technique has seen increasing use within the chemical process engineering field and this article summarizes some popular surrogates and their recent use in this area.},

If the activation function is continuous, bounded and nonconstant, then continuous mappings can be learned uniformly over compact input sets. We also give very general conditions ensuring that networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a function and its derivatives.}

  abstract = {Surrogate modeling is used to replace computationally expensive simulations. Neural networks have been widely applied as surrogate models that enable efficient evaluations over complex physical systems. Despite this, neural networks are data-driven models and devoid of any physics. The incorporation of physics into neural networks can improve generalization and data efficiency. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) is an approach to leverage known physical constraints present in the data, but it cannot strictly satisfy them in the predictions. This work proposes a novel physics-informed neural network, KKT-hPINN, which rigorously guarantees hard linear equality constraints through projection layers derived from KKT conditions. Numerical experiments on Aspen models of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) unit, an extractive distillation subsystem, and a chemical plant demonstrate that this model can further enhance the prediction accuracy.}

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

  abstract = {In this study, the operating conditions of an industrial fixed-bed ethylene oxide reactor are optimized via differential evolution (DE) algorithm to boost the ethylene oxide yield with taking into account the catalyst deactivation. A mathematical heterogenous model of the reactor has been used in order to evaluate the optimal operating conditions, both at steady state and dynamic conditions. Two different cases have been investigated in this regard. In the first case, optimum inlet molar flow rate, inlet pressure of the reaction side and temperatures of shell and tube sides have been obtained within their practical ranges. In the second case, a stepwise approach has been followed in order to determine the optimal temperature profiles for saturated water and gas in three steps during operation. The objective of each optimization case study is to maximize the ethylene oxide production rate. The effect of optimal operating conditions on the reactor performance has been compared with corresponding industrial conditions over a period of three operating years. 1.726% and 4.22% yield enhancement of ethylene oxide production can be achieved by application of first and second optimization case studies, respectively.}
