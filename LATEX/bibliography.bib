  abstract = {Abstract The ability to accurately model and simulate chemical processes has been paramount to the growing success and efficiency in process design and operation. These improvements usually come with increasing complexity of the underlying models leading to substantial computational effort in their use. It may also occur that the structure of the model is sometimes unknown making optimization and study difficult. To circumvent these issues, mathematically simpler models, commonly known as surrogate models, have been designed and used to successfully replace these complex, underlying models with much success. This technique has seen increasing use within the chemical process engineering field and this article summarizes some popular surrogates and their recent use in this area.},

Neural networks have been widely applied as surrogate models that enable efficient evaluations over complex physical systems. Despite this, neural networks are data-driven models and devoid of any physics. The incorporation of physics into neural networks can improve generalization and data efficiency. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) is an approach to leverage known physical constraints present in the data, but it cannot strictly satisfy them in the predictions. This work proposes a novel physics-informed neural network, KKT-hPINN, which rigorously guarantees hard linear equality constraints through projection layers derived from KKT conditions. Numerical experiments on Aspen models of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) unit, an extractive distillation subsystem, and a chemical plant demonstrate that this model can further enhance the prediction accuracy.}

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

As it is well-known, numerically one can at most find local solutions or stationary points unless a certain global problem structure is given. A standard problem structure which global optimization methods exploit is convexity, so that we develop our numerical approach for convex lower level problems. We stress that this convexity assumption with respect to the index variable y is not related to the usual convexity assumption in standard semi-infinite programming, where the upper level defining functions have to be convex with respect to the decision variable x (cf., e.g., [2, 62, 118]). Analogously, in linear semi-infinite programming the linearity is always assumed with respect to the upper level problem.",

  abstract = {Multi-stage Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a promising strategy for the design of robust NMPC controllers which is based on describing the evolution of the uncertainty as a scenario tree. The scenario tree makes it possible to consider explicitly that the future control inputs can be adapted to the future information (measurements), thus reducing the conservativeness of the robust approach. This paper reviews the multi-stage approach and illustrates its main advantages using a nonlinear CSTR example. We also provide guidelines for possible multi-stage NMPC users that could help to identify the problems where the use of multi-stage NMPC can result in a significant improvement with respect to standard NMPC or other robust NMPC approaches. Finally, we summarize the different modifications that can be done to the multi-stage approach to enhance its performance. The possible enhancements include: improved performance using parameter estimation, rigorous guarantee of constraint satisfaction, and stability guarantees for the case of discrete-valued uncertainties.}

  abstract = { This chapter develops dynamic optimization strategies that couple solvers for differential algebraic equations (DAEs) with NLP algorithms developed in the previous chapters. First, to provide a better understanding of DAE solvers, widely used Runge—Kutta and linear multistep methods are described, and a summary of their properties is given. A framework is then described for sequential dynamic optimization approaches that rely on DAE solvers to provide function information to the NLP solver. In addition, gradient information is provided by direct and adjoint sensitivity methods. Both methods are derived and described along with examples. Unfortunately, the sequential approach can fail on unstable and ill-conditioned systems. To deal with this case, we extend the sequential approach through the use of multiple shooting and concepts of boundary value solvers. Finally, a process case study is presented that illustrates both sequential and multiple shooting approaches. 9.1 Introduction Chapter 8 provided an overview of the features of dynamic optimization problems and their optimality conditions. From that chapter, it is clear that the extension to larger dynamic optimization problems requires efficient and reliable numerical algorithms. This chapter addresses this question by developing a popular approach for the optimization of dynamic process systems. Powerful DAE solvers for large-scale initial value problems have led to widely used simulation environments for dynamic nonlinear processes. The ability to develop dynamic process simulation models naturally leads to their extension for optimization studies. Moreover, with the development of reliable and efficient NLP solvers, discussed in Chapter 6, an optimization capability can be implemented for dynamic systems along the lines of modular optimization modes discussed in Chapter 7. With robust simulation models, the implementation of NLP codes can be done in a reasonably straightforward way. }

  abstract = {Abstract Die effektive Wärmeleitfähigkeit nicht durchströmter Schüttungen hängt stark von der Art der Berührung der Partikel ab; sie ist z. B. bei Kugeln und Zylindern unterschiedlich. Aus einem einfachen Modell werden Gleichungen entwickelt, die außer den Wärmeleitfähigkeiten der fluiden Phase und des Feststoffs die Porosität der Schüttung berücksichtigen. Die Gleichungen enthalten einen empirischen Anpassungsparameter, der nur von der Form der Partikel abhängt und aus in der Literatur veröffentlichten Meßwerten bestimmt wird.},

  abstract = {In this study, the operating conditions of an industrial fixed-bed ethylene oxide reactor are optimized via differential evolution (DE) algorithm to boost the ethylene oxide yield with taking into account the catalyst deactivation. A mathematical heterogenous model of the reactor has been used in order to evaluate the optimal operating conditions, both at steady state and dynamic conditions. Two different cases have been investigated in this regard. In the first case, optimum inlet molar flow rate, inlet pressure of the reaction side and temperatures of shell and tube sides have been obtained within their practical ranges. In the second case, a stepwise approach has been followed in order to determine the optimal temperature profiles for saturated water and gas in three steps during operation. The objective of each optimization case study is to maximize the ethylene oxide production rate. The effect of optimal operating conditions on the reactor performance has been compared with corresponding industrial conditions over a period of three operating years. 1.726% and 4.22% yield enhancement of ethylene oxide production can be achieved by application of first and second optimization case studies, respectively.}
